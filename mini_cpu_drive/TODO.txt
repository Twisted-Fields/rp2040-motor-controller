pins on debugger are wrong
can be worked around with custom compiled fimware and non straight through cable
SWDIO and RX swap
SWCLK and TX swap


note that picoprobe firmware has an "LED PIN" notion.
it is possible to support WS2812 here or could
put a normal LED on another pin

finally, we should change the pinout to follow the rp2040 debug
standard



// PIO config
#define PROBE_SM 0
#define PROBE_PIN_OFFSET 6
#define PROBE_PIN_SWCLK (PROBE_PIN_OFFSET + 0) // 6
#define PROBE_PIN_SWDIO (PROBE_PIN_OFFSET + 1) // 7

// Target reset config
#define PROBE_PIN_RESET 8
